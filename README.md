# Unhandled Exceptions in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart:  insufficient handling of exceptions during asynchronous operations.  The `bug.dart` file showcases the flawed code, while `bugSolution.dart` provides a more robust solution.

**Problem:** The original code lacks comprehensive exception handling, simply printing an error message instead of providing more informative error handling or recovery mechanisms.  This can lead to unexpected application behavior or crashes.

**Solution:** The solution file demonstrates improved exception handling with a more informative error message to the user, and a more robust way to handle failures.
